# WebSocket Client

A simple WebSocket Client that can be used for testing purposes , this also supports STOMP connections over SockJs (to be used with Spring-Boot for example)

This is my first extension and it was created to solve my testing needs so it's not feature rich and might be a little bit buggy but feel free to contribute or to open an issue
